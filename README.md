# Smoothrition
A simple app for calculating nutritional values of smoothies and the total price of ingredients used in them.

This app is a simple, quick project. It uses nutritional data from https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/ . The food is manually inserted as a way to ensure that names are stored in a local language (Serbian in this case), and to input the most recent prices of foods.
It has an option to calculate nuttritional value of either individual foods or multiple foods mixed in a smoothie.

Third party libraries used in this project: jQuery, Toastr, Select2, FontAwesome

I did not bother setting up an entire new framework, but only later have I realised that the additional time in setting up a framework would be negligible compared to the time spent in setting up a custom routing mechanism. Still - I believe that this can be an interesting project for someone new to PHP/js to either redo or upgrade the code.
